# MosaicPlus
OOP Final Project
Version 1: Was called Mosaic and had a mosaic pattern which consisted of random square and ovals in random colors with random letters displayed on them, also in random colors. Also when the user would press on one of the tiles, a random face would appear with either a smiling, neutral, or sad face. When the user would press the "Randomize" button, the shapes, colors, and letters would randomly change.

Version 2: Now called Mosaic Plus, will have some major advancements made to the previous Mosaic. Some of these advancements will be a color picker, colored background, sound effects, a menu, and new/save load functions.

As of now these are all of the feautres we would like to see implemented in Mosaic Plus and will try and make sure all are incorporated.

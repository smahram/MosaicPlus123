# MosaicPlus
# OOP Final Project

# To execute: java MosaicPlus

# Version 1: Was called Mosaic and had a mosaic pattern which consisted of random square and ovals in random colors with random letters  displayed on them, also in random colors. Also when the user would press on one of the tiles, a random face would appear with either a smiling, neutral, or sad face. When the user would press the "Randomize" button, the shapes, colors, and letters would randomly change.

# Version 2: Now called MosaicPlus, it will have some major advancements made compared to Mosaic. Some of these advancements will be giving the user a color picker where they will have color options for the tiles, some sound effects such as when the user clicks a tile or the "Randomize" button, having random shapes and numbers appear on the tiles, different layout options, the choice of whether the shapes should be random, all ovals, or all rectangles, and overall we have made a deatiled menu.

# As of now these are all of the feautres we would like to see implemented in Mosaic Plus and we will try and make sure all are incorporated.
